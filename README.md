# SGT - Student Grade Table

## Version 0.1
#### Description
Version 0.1 is the starting point of the Student Grade Table Project. LearningFuze has provided a base structure that
includes HTML structure that will need to be updated with boostrap classes. For this version we are looking to see that you
understand how to style an application with bootstrap, take input values and apply them to objects, and update the DOM
with a visual of those objects stored.

## Version 0.5
#### Description
Version 0.5 starts where v.1 left off with adding in the delete functionality. When clicking on the delete button we need
to add an event handler that will remove the current row from the DOM only after we have successfully removed the object
from the array.

## Version 1.0
#### Description
Version 1.0 picks up where 0.5 left off. You will now be populating records from a database via the LearningFuze SGT API. This version will only be pulling entries, you will not be adding anything to the database for this version. You should still be able to add entries locally as you did before.
